## The code for paper [Interpreting Key Mechanisms of Factual Recall in Transformer-Based Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19521.pdf).

The code is based on [Wang et al.](https://github.com/redwoodresearch/Easy-Transformer); I fixed some bugs, made it more efficient for inference, and enabled model-parallel to support multi-GPUs.

Just run the jupyter notebook.
